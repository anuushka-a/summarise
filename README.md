# YouTube Video Summarization Project
Welcome to the YouTube Video Summarization Project! This project aims to create concise summaries of YouTube videos using speech recognition and text summarization techniques. By leveraging automatic speech recognition (ASR) and text summarization, we can efficiently extract key insights from lengthy video content.

## Overview
In this project, we will:
- Download the audio of a YouTube video using the PyTube library.
- Perform automatic speech recognition (ASR) with the Hugging Face library.
- Chunk the audio into smaller segments to optimize memory usage.
- Transcribe each audio chunk into text using the ASR model.
- Combine the transcriptions to generate the full transcript of the video.

## Highlights
- Downloading Audio: Using the PyTube library, we download the audio of the YouTube video.
- Automatic Speech Recognition: We utilize the Hugging Face library for ASR, employing the Wave2Vec model.
- Audio Chunking: To optimize memory usage, we segment the audio into smaller chunks.
- Transcription and Combination: Each chunk is transcribed into text, and the transcriptions are combined to form the complete video transcript.

## Key Insights
- Unique Approach: Converting speech to text before summarization provides better control and potentially more accurate summaries.
- GPU Acceleration: Enabling GPU in Google Colab accelerates the summarization process, especially for longer videos.
- Memory Optimization: Audio chunking helps prevent out-of-memory errors and enables processing of longer videos.
- Hugging Face for ASR: The Hugging Face library offers a convenient interface for ASR with the Wave2Vec model.
- Summarization Possibilities: With the full transcript, various summarization techniques can be explored to create concise summaries.
- Timestamps for Reference: Timestamps provide a convenient reference for locating specific parts of the video in the transcript.
